# ProjetoFinal

## Instalation:

In order to run this application, we must first install python2.7.12 and pygame (for python2.7.x). Then just execute "python /path/to/app/Main.py".

### Ubuntu(Linux):

Ubuntu should already have python2.7.12 installed (you can check running "python --version" on the terminal). So we only have to install the apropriate pygame library. Simply run "sudo apt-get install python-pygame" and you are good to go.

### Windows/Mac:

#### Python:

Download the installer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/

#### Pygame:

Mac: Run "python -m pip install pygame --user"

Windows: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
